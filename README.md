Algorithm Challenge #34 – Commission Percentage Calculator
-
🧮 Problem Description
-
This challenge involves building a commission calculator in C++.
The user enters their total sales amount, and the program determines the correct commission percentage based on predefined ranges. After selecting the rate, it calculates the final commission value.

This type of logic is essential in business applications such as sales tracking systems, employee compensation tools, and performance dashboards.

🧠 Commission Rules

The commission percentage is assigned according to the following thresholds:

| Sales Amount | Commission Rate |


| ≥ 1,000,000  |              1% |

| ≥ 500,000    |              2% |

| ≥ 100,000    |              3% |

| ≥ 50,000     |              4% |

| ≥ 10,000     |              5% |

| < 10,000     |              0% |


Once the rate is determined, the program computes the commission using:
Rate × Sales = Total Commission
